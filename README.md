# Pure1 Unplugged
Pure1 Unplugged is Pure Storage's open-source on-premises fleet management system.

## Installation
Pure1 Unplugged can be installed from an ISO or an OVA. The latest versions, along with documentation, are pre-created and are available to download for free. Documentation is also available online.

## Development
Pure1 Unplugged can be built and run locally.

### Prerequisites
1. Forked and cloned source code
2. Minikube and required hypervisor: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

### Building
There are two separate Makefiles for building and testing. The main [Makefile](./Makefile) builds all available targets. The sub-Makefile 
[Makefile-golang](./Makefile-golang) has targets for building golang in a docker container. The top level Makefile looks for any target that matches the pattern `go-%` and will launch a container and make inside the container with the targets matching pattern.

_Example_: `make go-clean go-prep go-auth-server` runs the targets `clean prep auth-server` in a container.

### Testing
* Golang: `make go-unit-tests`
* Web content: `make test-web-content`

### Local deployment
1. Start minikube with at least 6GB memory and 40GB disk, and with the proper Kubernetes version.
   *  `minikube start --memory 6144 --disk-size 40g --kubernetes-version v1.13.4`
2. Build with `make all-minikube`
    * Note that build output goes into `./build/*`, and this `minikube` build mode will *not* create the installer ISO
3. Deploy with `./scripts/deploy/helm_install.sh $(minikube ip)`
    * Note that the deployment name must be `pure1-unplugged`
4. Run `minikube ip` and navigate to it in your browser
5. Log in with example
 
_Hint:_ Set `kubectl` to use `pure1-unplugged` namespace by running `kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=pure1-unplugged` for easier use.

### Updating a deployment

#### Updating golang
```
make go-bins
make pure-elk-image-minikube
make lorax-image
make helm-chart
helm upgrade pure-elk build/chart/*.tgz --force
```

#### Updating web content
```
make web-content
make pure-elk-image-minikube
make lorax-image
make helm-chart
helm upgrade pure-elk build/chart/*.tgz --force
```
